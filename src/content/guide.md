Two pieces work together:


1) **Fonea Companion GPT** → proposes songs, according to your vibes, generates curated track lists in JSON and exports them to your favorite streaming service (Spotify only for the moment!)
2) **Fonea Sound Curator App** → imports JSON, verifies tracks, collects your feedback, and exports it back.

## 1) Log into your favourite Streaming Service (optional)
Currently we're only able to connect to Spotify. Other Streaming services coming soon.


## 2) Start with a Vibe Brief (in GPT)
Begin here in the **Fonea Companion GPT**.
Describe the *vibe* you want — for example:

>“I want a dark synthwave playlist for late-night drives.”

>“Looking for warm indie tracks with cinematic energy.”

>“Need instrumental electronic songs for working.”


## 3) Import JSON (in the App)
Use **Import from ChatGPT** and paste the JSON block.


## 4&5) Verify & Review
- **Verified ✅** / **Failed ❌**
- Keep / Skip / Pending, plus short notes.
- Make sure to see why **Fonea Companion GPT** is recommending this song in the orange textbox
- When clicking the Keep button, you can save your songs to a specific playlist
- Songs in playlists will remain saved until you delete your cookies / cache


## 6) Replace Unverified
If a track is unverified:

- Click the Get Replacements button (orange).
- You’ll see a list of songs that couldn’t be verified.
- Click Copy Replacement Prompt — this copies a ready-to-paste message.
- Return to your Fonea Companion GPT and paste it in the text box as a continuation of the conversation.

Fonea Companion GPT will search verified alternatives and reply with a new JSON containing replacements.
Copy that new JSON and import it back into the app.


## 7) Export Feedback
Click **Export Feedback** and paste it back into GPT to get **Round N+1**.
**Make sure that you add some feedback of your own for Fonea Companion GPT** - this is where the magic really happens!


## 8) Iterate
Repeat import → review → export; the vibe evolves each round.

## 9) Review your playlist and export
- Click the playlists button
- Select your favorite playlist
- Review that the songs in the playlist are correct
- Push your playlist to Spotify (other services coming soon!)

**Shortcuts**
- Filter by **Round**, **Status**, **Verification**.
- If errors, copy the message and paste it in GPT for a fix.
