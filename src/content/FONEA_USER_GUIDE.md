## 📚 Managing Your Music Library

### Understanding Rounds

Fonea organizes recommendations into **rounds**:
- Each import creates a new round (Round 1, Round 2, etc.)
- Rounds help you track when you received each batch of recommendations
- You can filter and view songs by round

### Song Verification

Fonea automatically verifies songs using MusicBrainz:
- ✅ **Verified**: Real song, found in music database
- ⚠️ **Pending**: Verification in progress
- ❌ **Failed**: Song not found (may be incorrect info)

Verified songs get:
- Album art
- Preview links (30-second clips)
- Direct links to Spotify, Apple Music, and other platforms

---

## 💚 Giving Feedback

Track your preferences for each song:

| Status | Meaning | Icon |
|--------|---------|------|
| **Liked** | Love it! Want to add to playlists | 💚 |
| **Maybe** | Interesting, need to listen more | 🤔 |
| **Disliked** | Not for me | 💔 |
| **Pending** | Haven't listened yet | ⏳ |

**Why give feedback?**
- Helps you remember which songs you actually liked
- Fonea learns your preferences over time
- Easy to create playlists from only your "Liked" songs
