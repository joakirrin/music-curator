FONEA DEVELOPMENT LOG — SESSION SUMMARY (November 7, 2025)

---
PHASE CONTEXT
We completed setup for Phase 3 (Playlist Management) and prepared groundwork for Phases 4–5.
Focus areas:
- Spotify OAuth integration
- Playlist creation and previews
- ChatGPT API loop preparation
- Graphs for metadata visualization
- Multi-platform playlist export (later)

---
CHANGES MADE TODAY

1. Project cleanup
   - Verified and corrected src/App.tsx (removed duplicate exports, unified onboarding + main logic)
   - Confirmed Vite config (vite.config.ts) with host=0.0.0.0, allowedHosts=['*']
   - Ensured correct guide.css import paths (`../styles/guide.css` or `@/styles/guide.css`)
   - Added support for Markdown onboarding content (guide.md)

2. Fixed guide drawer + onboarding
   - Installed react-markdown and remark-gfm
   - Created src/content/guide.md (renamed from app-guide.md)
   - Added type declarations for ?raw imports (vite-raw.d.ts)
   - Confirmed working Drawer + Empty State components

3. Added in-app documentation / onboarding UI
   - GuideDrawer.tsx (markdown-rendered guide)
   - EmptyState.tsx (import prompt + quickstart steps)
   - useOnboardingFlag.ts (localStorage-driven guide open state)
   - guide.css (Fonea dark/neon style)

4. GitHub automation scripts
   - Created script: scripts/create_fonea_phase3_issues.sh (automatic issue creation for all Phase 3–5 tasks)
   - Adjusted to work with GitHub CLI (gh)
   - Added DRY_RUN flag for preview mode
   - Set repo: joakirrin/music-curator

5. Label management
   - Discovered label mismatch issues (old vs new naming convention)
   - Rebuilt a compatible script that uses existing labels:
     * phase:3
     * phase-4-playlist
     * phase-5-polish
     * priority-high / medium / low
     * status-not-started / status-in-progress / status-completed
     * type-task
   - Created helper: bootstrap_labels.sh (for label initialization)

6. Created new working issue script
   - scripts/create_fonea_phase3_issues_existing_labels.sh
   - Uses only existing GitHub labels (auto-adapts to repo state)
   - Successfully created 11 issues (#41–#51) in joakirrin/music-curator
   - Confirmed working with DRY_RUN=1 and without

7. Repository hygiene fixes
   - Removed stray EOF line causing “EOF: command not found” error
   - Verified correct permissions via chmod +x
   - Ensured all scripts executable in scripts/ directory

---
NEXT STEPS
1. Implement Spotify OAuth PKCE + playlist creation (Phase 3 core)
2. Add track previews (preview_url or Web Playback SDK fallback)
3. Begin metadata caching + Recharts graphs
4. After Spotify integration: implement ChatGPT API loop (Phase 4)
5. Later: multi-platform export (Phase 5)

---
NOTES
- Repository: https://github.com/joakirrin/music-curator
- All scripts verified working on macOS (M1)
- GitHub CLI authentication confirmed
- Fonea app compiles cleanly under Vite 5.4.x
